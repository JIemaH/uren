# Uren
Uren (hours in dutch) is a small script that calculates when and for how long I've worked.
Ideal for part-timers like me ;)

# Usage
1. Create a ``calendar_url.txt`` file that contains your private XML feed for the calendar you're interested in.
2. Edit ``uren.rb`` to your needs regarding selection to selection of relevant event names (as you can see in the source, I use '@home' and 'aanwezig').
3. Spend less time on hour registration.
4. World Domination
